  <h1>Makima's Slave</h1>
  <p>I dont like socializing much,i would rather spend my time alone or with a person
  i admire. In this instance there is a quote that i really love which is by <strong>Dulce Maria</strong>
  from the book <strong>Absolute Solitude</strong>.The quote being:<br>
  <em>"I wouldn't trade my solitude for a little love. For a lot of love, yes, But a lot of
  love  is itself kind of solitude"</em></p>

     <li><h2>Anime</h2></li>
     <p>I starting watching anime ever since i was 10 or 12 year old. I watched Naruto
     with my big sis and i got hooked onto anime and been watching since then. I have watched
     250+ animes and i still love to watch them. My most favourite one is <strong>Gintama</strong> </p>

     <li><h2>Games</h2></li>
     <p>I also used to play games a lot but games are mostly only fun for me when i am
     playing it with someone else(multiplayer games, etc).I played <strong>Farmville</strong> with my
     brothers, Counterstrike, etc.I used to play Clash of clans as well but now i mainly only play
     League of legends with friends and stuff but i think i will leave this as well eventually and maybe
     stop playing games forever at some point.</p>
     <li><h2>Manga</h2></li>
     <p>I used to think that manga was boring since just watching pages and no bg music and voice
     would make it boring but i read <em>Solo Leveling</em> due to a facebook recommandation,which i really
     loved(that is also my most favourite manga), from then i started reading other manga's and to my surprise
     there were really fun.</p>

     <li><h2>Books</h2></li>
     <p>I also started reading books due to <strong>Wasif</strong> recommandation and i really fell in love
     with them, but its hard to find time to read them but i will start reading them more and more in future. My
     favourite genre would by Psycological/Philosophical. To me the concept of a man thinking about his inner
     boundaries and realising what to do and what he is supposed to do is really fascinating. My most favourite
     author would be <strong>Fyodor Dostoevysky.</strong></p>

     <li><h2>Music</h2></li>
     <p>I didnt used to like music much as a kid but as i grew and even now,I have started to love it so much.
     It kind of sinks you in and you create a different imaginery world in your head depending on what you are listening.
     I love banger/hype music genres like <em>DrumnBeat, Psychedelic, Dubstep</em>, etc but i also love chill/sad songs
     like <em>lofi and stuff</em>.My favourite music artist is <strong>Shiloh Dynasty</strong> but recenetly
     <strong>Joji</strong>has been on my mind a lot.</p>

     <li><h2>Art</h2></li>
     <p>I really love looking at art as well,It feels great to look at faboulous art. Sometimes I feel like wanting to
     draw, but I can't even draw a straight line so that's a no, I guess.My favourites artist is <b>Yuumei</b></p>

     <li><h2>Tv Shows</h2></li>
     <p>I started Tv shows as well recently, i dont watch them very often though but they are fun sometimes. They contain
     unnecessary sexual and relationship stuff which makes it boring for me somtimes. My favourite series would be
     <b>Peaky Blinders.</b></p>
